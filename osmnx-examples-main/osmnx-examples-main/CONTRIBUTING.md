# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for using OSMnx and for considering contributing to it! This issue tracker is for proposing new examples or specific changes to existing examples.

**Do not open an issue here** for "how-to" questions: they should be asked on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=osmnx) instead.

**Do not open an issue here** for OSMnx problems: those go in the [OSMnx repo's issue tracker](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx).

## Contribute an example/demo

  - post your proposal in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/issues) or submit a PR with the new Jupyter notebook
  - respond to code review

Every piece of software is a work in progress. This project is the result of many hours of work contributed freely by myself and the many people that build the projects it depends on. Thank you for contributing!
